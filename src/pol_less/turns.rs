//! Which injector starts may run at the same time.
//!
//! Sign-ins never wait here: each account signs in on its own thread first. Only the tool
//! start is gated, and only as far as the tools need:
//!
//! - **Windower 4**: its injection handshake writes settings into the fixed-name file mapping
//!   `WindowerMMFSettingsHandler`, creates the fixed-name auto-reset event
//!   `windower.signal-injection`, injects Hook.dll, waits for Hook.dll to signal, disposes both,
//!   and only then resumes the game's main thread. Two handshakes at once could swap settings
//!   blocks or take each other's signal, and Windower.exe shows nothing outside between the
//!   dispose and the resume. The first thing observable after it is the loader's `hello`, which
//!   the loader sends about 1 ms into its `main`. So one Windower start at a time, from spawn
//!   to hello, is the whole handshake, with no margin on top.
//! - Windower also writes its profile's video and sound values into the shared
//!   `HKLM\...\FinalFantasyXI` key before every start. That no longer orders anything: the
//!   launcher sends the same values as `ffxi_settings` and crystal-loader serves them to each
//!   game in-process, so a start with another profile goes
//!   as soon as the previous start's hello, like one with the same profile.
//! - **Ashita v4**: Ashita-cli imports no mutex, event or file-mapping APIs and uses no
//!   fixed object names; it hands `InstallAshita` its parameters in the target process's own
//!   memory, and each account has its own generated boot ini. Ashita starts run in parallel.
//! - **Vanilla**: each account starts its own host and private pipe directly, with no injector.
