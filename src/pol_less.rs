//! Retail launches directly, through Ashita v4, or through Windower 4.
//!
//! The launcher starts the game host directly or through Ashita-cli/Windower and hands
//! credentials to the verified loader over a private named pipe.
//! The installed native PlayOnline core authenticates and owns the retail session;
//! the headless launcher worker supervises it independently of the iced window.
//!
//! Secrets never appear on a command line, in the environment, in Ashita's boot ini or
//! config.json, or in the per-launch log; they reach the loader only through its pipe.
