//! Launch stage timing: how long each step takes from the Play click to the game running.
//!
//! A `Timeline` records elapsed time (a monotonic `Instant`, one small `Vec` push per mark)
//! for the sign-in stages and for the milestones every launch path shares. It only ever sees
//! stage names and fixed milestone labels, never account fields or session bytes.
//!
//! Output has three shapes:
//! - one compact line per mark for the launch's own log (`unwritten_lines`),
//! - a one-line summary for `launch-history.log` (`summary`): each phase's own duration,
//!   ending with the total from the click, e.g. `sign-in 2.8s, tool 0.4s, hello 1.9s,
//!   game started 9.4s`,
//! - a short line for the account row (`row_summary`), both figures from the click:
//!   `Signed in 2.8s · game started 9.4s`.
