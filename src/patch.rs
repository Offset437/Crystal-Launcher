//! Retail version checks, shaped like the stock PlayOnline Viewer's.
//! Packet framing is implemented by updater::polp.
//! These query Square Enix directly; they never apply a patch or use credentials.
//!
//! Stock sends exactly two version requests (one POLP frame each, to port
//! `53000 + product id` of that product's patch host, reply read, connection closed;
//! hosts in `dns`: `pt008.pol.com` for the Viewer, `pc001W2U.pol.com` for FFXI):
//! * the Viewer's own check (`W2U`, product `1000`, port 54000, the Viewer's installed
//!   version) at Connect, after Open(0) and 39-62 ms before the :51240 member login
//!   (pol-spec 07a w2u-at-connect; stock 18.917 FIN → 18.979 SYN). One per sign-in,
//!   never cached, never at launcher start (`viewer_connect_check`);
//! * the game's check (`W20`, product `0001`, port 53001, FFXI's installed version) when
//!   Play is pressed, after the main menu's publish and before the game starts
//!   (07a w20-after-publish; the launcher decides when).
//! Neither is queried on refresh, on a timer, or after a settings save. Both go out on
//! `stock_socket`'s Viewer-shaped socket. Empty versions are sent only for a fresh install.
